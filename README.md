# Calculator
Free Code Camp - Front End Project.


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erolozge/Calculator/master/Calculator.png)Calculator Project!

This is first project of Advanced Front End Development Projects in Free Code Camp.

I created this project by using HTML,CSS and JavaScript on Sublime Text.

In this project, I can do four operations which are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. If I press wrong button, I can delete it with "CE" button. Also, I can clear the input field with a clear "AC" button.
I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
